===========
What is it?
===========

This is a status bar for your linux system that displays items such as:
    
    - Workspace
    - Date and time
    - Brightness level
    - Volume level
    - Wifi strength
    - Battery level

and more items can be added to it, removed from it, or moved around, if the user
wishes to do so. The user also has the option of adding more workspaces, 
changing the size and location of the status bar, and many more things as well.



=============
Documentation
=============

This status bar was primarily built to be used under the DWM window manager 
because I did not like the one that DWM comes with. I wanted to have the 
option of adding icon widgets to the status bar if I wanted to, and since 
DWM's status bar does not have that option, I made my own.


The documentation for each script is available in the headers of each respective
script.
